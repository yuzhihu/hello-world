Hi Guys, 

Yuzhi here. I am a PhD student at the Australian National University. 

My research concerns the evolution of early vertebrate anatomy, especially amongst placoderms (armoured jawed ﬁsh). The internal anatomy of the placoderm skull reveals a wealth of anatomical information. Most importantly, the internal (endochondral) skeleton is an ubiquitous feature of vertebrates, lending itself to a broad comparison even comparison with very distantly related lineages or groups that may have few outward resemblances. However, the endochondral skeleton may be diﬃcult or impossible to access in some fossils without permanently destroying the specimen.

I use high resolution micro-CT scanning (less than 2 microns) and Drishti (3D visualization software) to extract endocranial data of a 3D preserved articulated buchanosteid arthrodire (ANU V244) from Burrinjuck, NSW. I also use 3D Printing techiniques to investigate its functional morphology, as well as Mesquite and TNT for character coding and phylogenetic analysis. My study tries to answer the question that how brain evolved in the Devonian period amongst ancient ﬁshes. I will also study the relationships between ANU V244 and other species of arthrodires and try to discover new relationships which may help solving ANU V244’s position in the phylogenetic tree, therefore better understanding the evolution history of arthrodires (placoderm ﬁsh).
